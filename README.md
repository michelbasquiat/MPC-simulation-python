# MPC-simulation-python
As an undergraduate thesis project, a simulator was developed to implement an MPC controller for the trajectory control of an agricultural self-propelled sprayer. The objective was to evaluate the performance of the MPC controller in comparison to other classical controllers found in the literature.
